/** Processing mode informs the Plug-in about the context and at which frequency the process call is called.
VST3 defines 3 modes:
- kRealtime: each process call is called at a realtime frequency (defined by [numSamples of ProcessData] / samplerate).
             The Plug-in should always try to process as fast as possible in order to let enough time slice to other Plug-ins.
- kPrefetch: each process call could be called at a variable frequency (jitter, slower / faster than realtime),
             the Plug-in should process at the same quality level than realtime, Plug-in must not slow down to realtime
             (e.g. disk streaming)!
             The host should avoid to process in kPrefetch mode such sampler based Plug-in.
- kOffline:  each process call could be faster than realtime or slower, higher quality than realtime could be used.
             Plug-ins using disk streaming should be sure that they have enough time in the process call for streaming,
             if needed by slowing down to realtime or slower.
.
Note about Process Modes switching:
    -Switching between kRealtime and kPrefetch process modes are done in realtime thread without need of calling
     IAudioProcessor::setupProcessing, the Plug-in should check in process call the member processMode of ProcessData
     in order to know in which mode it is processed.
    -Switching between kRealtime (or kPrefetch) and kOffline requires that the host calls IAudioProcessor::setupProcessing
     in order to inform the Plug-in about this mode change. */

/** Queue of changes for a specific parameter.
\ingroup vstIHost vst300
- [host imp]
- [released: 3.0.0]

The change queue can be interpreted as segment of an automation curve. For each
processing block a segment with the size of the block is transmitted to the processor.
The curve is expressed as sampling points of a linear approximation of
the original automation curve. If the original already is a linear curve it can
be transmitted precisely. A non-linear curve has to be converted to a linear
approximation by the host. Every point of the value queue defines a linear
section of the curve as a straight line from the previous point of a block to
the new one. So the Plug-in can calculate the value of the curve for any sample
position in the block.

<b>Implicit Points:</b> \n
In each processing block the section of the curve for each parameter is transmitted.
In order to reduce the amount of points, the point at block position 0 can be omitted.
- If the curve has a slope of 0 over a period of multiple blocks, only one point is
transmitted for the block where the constant curve section starts. The queue for the following
blocks will be empty as long as the curve slope is 0.
- If the curve has a constant slope other than 0 over the period of several blocks, only
the value for the last sample of the block is transmitted. In this case the last valid point
is at block position -1. The processor can calculate the value for each sample in the block
by using a linear interpolation:
\code
double x1 = -1; // position of last point related to current buffer
double y1 = currentParameterValue; // last transmitted value

int32 pointTime = 0;
ParamValue pointValue = 0;
IParamValueQueue::getPoint (0, pointTime, pointValue);

double x2 = pointTime;
double y2 = pointValue;

double slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1);
double offset = y1 - (slope * x1);

double curveValue = (slope * bufferTime) + offset; // bufferTime is any position in buffer
\endcode

<b>Jumps:</b> \n
A jump in the automation curve has to be transmitted as two points: one with the
old value and one with the new value at the next sample position.

For each processing block the host provides timing information and
