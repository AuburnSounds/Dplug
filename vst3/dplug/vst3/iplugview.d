\par Sizing of a view
Usually the size of a Plug-in view is fixed. But both the host and the Plug-in can cause
a view to be resized:
\n
- <b> Host </b> : If IPlugView::canResize () returns kResultTrue the host will setup the window
  so that the user can resize it. While the user resizes the window
  IPlugView::checkSizeConstraint () is called, allowing the Plug-in to change the size to a valid
  rect. The host then resizes the window to this rect and has to call IPlugView::onSize ().
\n
\n
- <b> Plug-in </b> : The Plug-in can call IPlugFrame::resizeView () and cause the host to resize the
  window.
  Afterwards in the same callstack the host has to call IPlugView::onSize () if a resize is needed (size was changed).
  Note that if the host calls IPlugView::getSize () before calling IPlugView::onSize () (if needed),
  it will get the current (old) size not the wanted one!!
  Here the calling sequence:
    * plug-in->host: IPlugFrame::resizeView (newSize)
    * host->plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the currentSize (not the newSize)!
    * host->plug-in: if newSize is different from the current size: IPlugView::onSize (newSize)
    * host->plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the newSize
\n
<b>Please only resize the platform representation of the view when IPlugView::onSize () is
called.</b>

\par Keyboard handling
The Plug-in view receives keyboard events from the host. A view implementation must not handle
keyboard events by the means of platform callbacks, but let the host pass them to the view. The host
depends on a proper return value when IPlugView::onKeyDown is called, otherwise the Plug-in view may
cause a malfunction of the host's key command handling!
