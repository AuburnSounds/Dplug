/** \defgroup vstBus VST Buses
Bus Description

A bus can be understood as a "collection of data channels" belonging together.
It describes a data input or a data output of the Plug-in.
A VST component can define any desired number of buses, but this number must \b never change.
Dynamic usage of buses is handled in the host by activating and deactivating buses.
The component has to define the maximum number of supported buses and it has to
define which of them are active by default. A host that can handle multiple buses,
allows the user to activate buses that were initially inactive.
