    Dplug is an open-source audio plug-in framework existing since 2013.

    A plugin framework is a library whose aim is to make cross-platform audio development 
    a practical reality. As such, Dplug can be used to create audio effects (such as a VST 2.4) 
    for use in popular host programs (such as FLStudio, Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase...).
